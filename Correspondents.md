Mats:
Erasmus Montanus, Dispudiant Sophist?
Same as reedy and petulant voice?
What he believes becomes true, to a certain extent, but his beliefs are forced to be mostly theoretical. One major exception is what he believes about other people's motivations, skills, and opinions.
Loves pointless debates. Is useless in most practical situations, because he believes he shouldn't have to deal with them.
