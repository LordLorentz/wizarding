_One drop. Two drops._

Marasmus stared at the floor below him. Ancient cobbles, rutted with dirt and nameless grit, glistening in the dank air. A small pool of blood had formed, and was slowly snaking its way through the cracks between the cobbles.

_One drop. Two drops._

His good eye was focused on the ripples the drops made as they splashed into the pool; the other one flicking from side to side, running like a rat in a cage.
Pieces of rusted metal were littered around the corners of the room; be they scythes or swords, decay had left the difference invisible. All forgotten weapons of war, in the end.

_One drop. Two drops._

Only seven of his teeth were intact. At first, he’d counted them over and over, touching each of the broken stumps with his tongue. It served as something to do, but in time it became clear to him that the number of teeth he had left would not change without outside intervention.
He didn’t care to look at his wrists, and could no longer feel them either. But he knew they were shackled to the wall above him, carrying so much of his weight that blood was running down his arms. Uneven stones prodded into his back, his legs hanging uselessly below him.

_One drop. Two drops._

A few locks of matted and greasy hair framed Marasmus’ view, like stalactites of human refuse. But the binding on his life forced the blood to flow up, into his mouth, rather than dripping from his locks. Teeth were the solution, in the end. Coated in red, part of him but not, bones but exposed. Slowly, his blood would seep out of this body, past the teeth.

*One drop. Two drops.*

Were those distant footsteps he heard? Marasmus shifted his position, trying to put more weight on his wrists, but knew that it was likely pointless, by now.
Snatches of conversation drifted over from a hallway he couldn’t see, and he needed all the information he could get. Choking out another unwilling breath, Marasmus focused on his hearing.

“...can’t just _forget_ your shift in checking on the necromancer! Suppose he dies. Then what? We don’t even have _any_ plans for-”

“We don’t have any plans because that situation would be hopeless. I know. You don’t have to go on about it,” a second speaker added, reproachfully.

“Apparently I do, because you just won’t hold on to the fact! Now, I want to make sure you-”

“It’s unlikely I’ll forget in the last twenty meters to his cell, alright? Just let me handle things. I’ll ask Limerence to lend me a hand.”

The barely successful attempt to bite back a pointless, bickering response could be felt trough the walls.
The first voice was reedy and petulant, unpleasant but not a personal insult. Killing them once would do. The second voice, oh how he longed to forget that second voice, full and obnoxious, always lurking in the back of the mind like a self-satisfied toad on a stone. _Memento Mori_. The blaggard. He had _plans_ in store for-

Marasmus’ internal monologue was cut short when the ancient, black-oaken, steel-studded door to his cell was first turned into a laughable piece of white-painted particle board, then pushed aside with utter disregard. Memento Mori strode into the room, pinching the bridge of his nose.

“Lim? He’s changed the room again. Any ideas?”

A cool, androgynous voice rang from a point near the middle of the room, “A few. You could finish him. That would be interesting.”

“For you, yeah. Anything feasible?”, Memento asked.

“Sure. Take the space, and make it our own. It'd need us all to meet here with some regularity, but I think once a week should suffice to sequester his blit admittance to the memetic plane - which you can forget about.”

“Stop it, you. You’re making my head spin. I can’t follow you in all this.”

“Oh? You certainly did like it when I left you spinning, last time. You sure about that?”

A faint flicker of unease passed over Memento’s features, like he’d forgotten something pleasant, before he shook it off.

“All-right, let’s just clean the place up, then”, he said.

An orb popped into existence above Memento’s hand, at first reflecting the room like a soap bubble, then quickly changing the image on its surface to carved alabaster pillars, beautiful frescoes on the walls, polished marble floor, littered with sand, a massive granite slab serving as a table, surrounded by seven simple chairs. Lastly, the low, gloomy ceiling reflected in the orb turned into a high, airy arch, painted with the image of the Greek goddess, Athena.

“Well then. That ought to do,” Memento said, flippantly tossing the orb to the center of the cell. When it hit about a meter from the floor, it rolled on the table depicted inside itself, and, to ensure the possibility of this happening, swapped the inside with the outside.

“About a second too late, but we can’t all be perfect.”
Memento Mori looked up, pleasantly surprised, as the painting of Athena on the ceiling shifted, like the stone was coming alive.

“Not a bad form-”, Limerence spoke, as cracks filled the ceiling, spreading around the painting as it angled itself on the stone.

The ceiling broke, and most of the stones floated upward, into a wide shaft with walls of sandstone, decorated with arches and grape-vine patterns Esher would have given an arm and a leg to see. The end of it disappeared in a white mist, where several tonnes of rock would soon confound the night-time cleaning crew of --Academical building? Somebody finish this joke, please.

Limerence dropped onto the granite table with a heavy crack, clothing draping around them as it turned from painted stone to fabric.

“-not bad at all,” they said, dusting themselves off.

“That’s high praise coming from you, Lim,” Memento countered, grinning insipidly.

____

Limerence approached Marasmus, sashaying slightly, wearing their golden laurel like the Greek goddess, their gaze enough to soothe even the most deranged lunatic, now clashing with his undisguised reproach.
The rusted cuffs that held him changed, instantly. Their texture turned fluffy, and a pink so vitriolic he could feel it in his fingers. The wall behind him was covered in rubberized padding, the comfort a sore insult to his predicament.

Taking him by the chin, Limerence spoke candidly,
“There’s no death here, love. You’re in heaven, now.”
