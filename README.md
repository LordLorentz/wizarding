### Despair

_One drop. Two drops._

Marasmus stared at the floor below him. Ancient cobbles, rutted with dirt and nameless grit, glistening in the dank air. A small pool of blood had formed, and was slowly snaking its way through the cracks between the cobbles.

_One drop. Two drops._

His good eye was focused on the ripples the drops made as they splashed into the pool; the other one flicking from side to side, running like a rat in a cage.
Pieces of rusted metal were littered around the corners of the room; be they scythes or swords, decay had left the difference invisible. All forgotten weapons of war, in the end.

_One drop. Two drops._

Only seven of his teeth were intact. At first, he’d counted them over and over, touching each of the broken stumps with his tongue. It served as something to do, but in time it became clear to him that the number of teeth he had left would not change without outside intervention.
He didn’t care to look at his wrists, and could no longer feel them either. But he knew they were shackled to the wall above him, carrying so much of his weight that blood was running down his arms. Uneven stones prodded into his back, his legs hanging uselessly below him.

_One drop. Two drops._

A few locks of matted and greasy hair framed Marasmus’ view, like stalactites of human refuse. But the binding on his life forced the blood to flow up, into his mouth, rather than dripping from his locks. Teeth were the solution, in the end. Coated in red, part of him but not, bones but exposed. Slowly, his blood would seep out of this body, past the teeth.

*One drop. Two drops.*

Were those distant footsteps he heard? Marasmus shifted his position, trying to put more weight on his wrists, but knew that it was likely pointless, by now.
Snatches of conversation drifted over from a hallway he couldn’t see, and he needed all the information he could get. Choking out another unwilling breath, Marasmus focused on his hearing.

“...can’t just _forget_ your shift in checking on the necromancer! Suppose he dies. Then what? We don’t even have _any_ plans for-”

“We don’t have any plans because that situation would be hopeless. I know. You don’t have to go on about it,” a second speaker added, reproachfully.

The first speaker countered, “Apparently I *do*, because you just won’t hold on to the fact! Now, I want to make sure you-”

“It’s unlikely I’ll forget in the last twenty meters to his cell, alright? Just let me handle things. I’ll ask Limerence to lend me a hand.”

The barely successful attempt to bite back a pointless, bickering response could be felt through the walls.
The first voice was reedy and petulant, unpleasant but not a personal insult. Killing them once would do. The second voice, oh how he longed to forget that second voice, full and obnoxious, always lurking in the back of the mind like a self-satisfied toad on a stone. _Memento Mori_. The blaggard. He had _plans_ in store for-

Marasmus’ internal monologue was cut short when the ancient, black-oaken, steel-studded door to his cell was first turned into a laughable piece of white-painted particle board, then pushed aside with utter disregard. Memento Mori strode into the room, pinching the bridge of his nose.

“Lim? He’s changed the room again. Any ideas?”

A cool, androgynous voice rang from a point near the middle of the room, “A few. You could finish him. That would be interesting.”

“For you, yeah. Anything feasible?”, Memento asked, his patience restored.

“Sure. Take the space, and make it our own. It'd need us all to meet here with some regularity", the voice spoke, echoing more and more until it seemed the walls themselves were droning out the words. "But I think once a week should suffice to sequester his blit admittance to the memetic plane, where you can forget about it for good.”

“Stop it, you. You’re making my head spin. I can’t follow you with all this”, Memento sputtered as the echoes died away.

Once again clear and mildly teasing, the voice said, “Oh? You certainly did like it when I left you spinning, last time. You sure about that?” 

A faint flicker of unease passed over Memento’s features, like he’d forgotten something pleasant, before he shook it off.

“All-right, let’s just clean the place up, then”, he said.

An orb popped into existence above Memento’s hand, at first reflecting the room like a soap bubble, then quickly changing the image on its surface to carved alabaster pillars, beautiful frescoes on the walls, polished marble floor, littered with sand, a massive granite slab serving as a table, surrounded by seven stone chairs. Lastly, the low, gloomy ceiling reflected in the orb turned into a high, airy arch, painted with the image of the Greek goddess, Athena.

“Well then. That ought to do,” Memento said, flippantly tossing the orb to the center of the cell. When it hit about a meter from the floor, it rolled on the table depicted inside itself, and, to ensure the possibility of this happening, swapped the inside with the outside.

“About a second too late, but we can’t all be perfect.”
Memento Mori looked up, pleasantly surprised, as the painting of Athena on the ceiling shifted, like it was coming alive.

“Not a bad form-”, Limerence spoke, cracks filling the ceiling, spreading around the painting as it angled itself on the stone.

The ceiling broke, and most of the stones floated upward, into a wide shaft with walls of sandstone, decorated with arches and grape-vine patterns Escher would have given an arm and a leg to see. The end of it disappeared in a white mist, where several tonnes of rock would soon confound the night-time cleaning crew of --Academical building? Somebody finish this joke, please.

Limerence dropped onto the granite table with a heavy crack, clothing draping around them as it turned from painted stone to fabric.

“-not bad at all,” they said, dusting themselves off.

“That’s high praise coming from you, Lim,” Memento countered, grinning insipidly.

Sweeping around, Limerence walked to the chair facing Marasmus, on the far side of the table. As they bend down, the ridge of their spine becomes visible through the white cloth; a line, at first, then splitting into two, writhing like snakes, then forming strange depressions, boiling like a potful of frogs.
Memento stared blankly to the side, successfully forgetting what he'd just seen. No such luck for Marasmus.
The chair, in the meantime, had become a thing of melted brass and nightmarish owl motifs, a throne suitable only for the foolish and the mad.

"Fortunately, I'm both", Limerence said, their head twisted around a hundred and eighty degrees, looking at Marasmus like they could hear his thoughts. Turning their body, the crazed grimace evaporated from their face.
Then, Limerence approached Marasmus, sashaying slightly, wearing their golden laurel like the Greek goddess, their gaze enough to soothe even the most deranged lunatic, now clashing with his undisguised reproach.
The rusted cuffs that held him changed, instantly. Their texture turned fluffy, and a pink so vitriolic he could feel it in his fingers. The wall behind him was covered in rubberized padding, the comfort a sore insult to his predicament.

Taking him by the chin, Limerence spoke candidly,
“There’s no death here, love. You’re in heaven, now.”

### Magnificence

Making his way to the library, Erasmus Montanus adjusted his collar, the concrete stairs beneath his feet adjusting for his wandering gait.
"That sure showed him! Sweeping off like a true Master, dealing with a respectless commoner like him. Ho, next time, Memento Mori had better prepare if he would wish to maintain his dignity. Not that he would, of course. Truly-",  Erasmus thought to himself, interrupted by his opening the glass pane in the door in front of him, reaching through, and removing the latch.
"-The man is hopeless," Erasmus continued, "He hasn't even figured out how to get into my library, and it's been months! Surely, an unenlightened mind like his would crave for the intellectual treasures of our Contemporaries. And yet, I've never once seen him try-"
Erasmus paused for a moment, looking at the sunlight infiltrating through the arched windows at the south of the library. He'd arrived at his desk, positioned carefully to afford him a view of every entrance a polite visitor would use. All the while, his internal monologue rambled on incessantly.
"-To get in here. Ah, what a wonderful place I've built here. Or, I should say 'we', for without the efforts of countless Gentlemen before me, I could not have brought such architecture to bear! No, these arches of bowed wood, the Lindscrey-Manton cataloguing by which our books are sorted, even the book-binding of the volumes themselves-"
By now, there was a slight flush across his face and a tear in his eye. Leaning back into his solid oak chair, which fit his slim frame like an ox's yoke would fit a horse, his gaze wandered across the bookshelves rising up to the rafters. Through the carved wooden railings of the second story, he could see the grand entrance to the library, reserved for special guests. About to turn his attention inward once again, Erasmus froze, the sunlight changing, like that glorious blaze was now but a pinprick in a black sky.
A deep knocking sounded from behind the door, then from under the floor, then from within one of the bookcases.

Clearing his throat, Erasmus spoke, "C-Come in."

All the shadows had turned sharp, and even though the colour was still there, it seemed insignificant compared to the contrast of light and dark. Bit by bit, the carpeted floor changed into roughly worked obsidian, with tool marks resembling the pattern that used to be part of the carpet.


vvv Work in progress
Silently, Vreta strode into the room

Droplets of cold sweat were beginning to form on his brow, but he made no effort to wipe them off.

"And be sure to clean up after yourself!" Erasmus shouted, once he was sure she was out of earshot.
Letting out a long sigh, he waved his right hand removing the obsidian veins running through the walls of the library. He didn't move for a long time, after.
